        "In a food processor, combine soaked chickpeas, onion, garlic, dill, parsley, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, black pepper, salt, and cayenne. Pulse until coarse but holds together—do not purée.",
        "Transfer mixture to a bowl. Stir in baking powder and flour. Start with 1 1/2 tbsp flour and add more if needed to bind the mixture.",
        "Optional: Chill mixture for 20–30 minutes to help it firm up.",
        "Form mixture into small balls or patties (about 1 tbsp each) and place them on the prepared baking sheet.",
        "Lightly brush or spray the tops with oil. Bake for 22–25 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown and slightly crisp."
