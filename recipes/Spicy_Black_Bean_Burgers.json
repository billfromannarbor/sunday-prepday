        "Form into 4 patties. If mixture is soft, chill in the fridge for 15–30 minutes to help firm up.",
        "Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil and lightly grease.",
        "Place patties on the sheet, lightly brush or spray tops with oil. Bake for 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway through.",
